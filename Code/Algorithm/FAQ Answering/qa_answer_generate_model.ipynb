To curb this, social distancing and good hand hygiene advise is advocated by World health Organization (WHO). We argue that COVID 19 coronovirus can also be airborne in a puff cloud loaded with infected droplets generated by COVID sick person. An elementary calculation shows that a $5~\\mu m$ respiratory infected droplet can remain suspended for about 9.0 minutes and a $2~\\mu m$ droplet can remain suspended for about an hour!

There is only rare and unquantified evidence of infectious, replication-capable SARS-CoV-2 in recently shed feces of COVID-19 hospital patients. The human infectivity dose-response relationship of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, thereby making it impossible to estimate evidence-based quantitative health effects assessments by quantitative microbial risk assessment methods requiring both known exposure assessment and health effects assessment data.

In addition to community onset, nosocomial acquisition and transmission may also occur. Detection of <span class='answer'>asymptomatic</span> shedders (e.g., patients in the incubation period or immunosuppressed long term shedders) facilitates control of nosocomial transmission. Methods: To strengthen the existing infection control concept, a PCR-based screening for RSV and influenza virus was implemented for all patients lacking respiratory symptoms (asymptomatic patients) who were hospitalized on an adult and a pediatric hemato-oncological ward. Laboratory results of this screening were analyzed retrospectively. Results: 665 respiratory specimens were obtained for screening from 251 patients (26% were 18 years and younger) from December 2016 to April 2017. In 23 patients without respiratory symptoms, either influenza virus or RSV infection was found, resulting in a detection rate of about 9%. In 6 patients, the infection was presumably detected during the incubation period, because an increase of viral load was observed in subsequent specimens. Positive screening results facilitated timely implementation of adequate infection control precautions. Nosocomial clusters of RSV or influenza were not detected during the screening period on the two wards. Conclusion: The seasonal screening program expanded our existing infection control concept in terms of patients lacking respiratory symptoms who shed influenza virus or RSV. It enabled us to identify 23 RSV or influenza infections in patients lacking respiratory symptoms in a 4-month period and thus to rapidly take isolation precautions.</div>"

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection can be categorized by severity: asymptomatic infection, mild illness, moderate illness, severe illness, and critical illness. The rate of transmission to a specific group of contacts (the secondary attack rate) may be 3–25 times lower from people who are <span class='answer'>asymptomatically</span> infected than from those with symptoms. The incubation period is 2–14 days. What is added by this report? An individual with asymptomatic infection shed live virus that started a 42-case outbreak in Shunyi District of Beijing in December 2020. The individual had been quarantined for 14 days in a designated quarantine hotel in Fuzhou after entering China from Indonesia. During quarantine, he had 5 negative throat swab tests and 2 negative IgM serum tests. The investigation team determined that the incubation periods of 31 confirmed cases ranged from 2 to 23 days. What are the implications for public health practice? The frequency of nucleic acid testing should be increased for international entrants and people who are close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The investigation team recommend expanding sample types for nucleic acid testing to include anal swabs and residential environmental sampling; serum antibody testing can be used as a reference indicator. Parallel testing by two institutions at key points in time, such as the end of isolation, should be implemented.</div>"

Despite extensive knowledge of AIV in Asian LAMs, little is known about the prevalence South American LAMs. To fill this gap in knowledge, active surveillance was carried out at the major LAM in Medellin, Colombia between February and September 2015. During this period, overall prevalence in the market was 2.67% and a North American origin H11N2 AIV most similar to a virus isolated from Chilean shorebirds <span class='answer'>asymptomatically</span> spread through multiple bird species in the market resulting in 17.0% positivity at peak of infection. Phenotypically, the H11 viruses displayed no known molecular markers associated with increased virulence in birds or mammals, had α2,3-sialic acid binding preference, and caused minimal replication in vitro and little morbidity in vivo. However, the Colombian H11N2 virus replicated and transmitted effectively in chickens explaining the spread throughout the market. Genetic similarity to H11 viruses isolated from North and South American shorebirds suggest that the LAM occurrence may have resulted from a wild bird to domestic poultry spillover event. The ability to spread in domestic poultry as well as potential for human infection by H11 viruses highlight the need for enhanced AIV surveillance in South America in both avian species and humans.</div>"

Based on the current mechanistic understanding of how VRDs are transmitted by small droplets, we identify an environmental variable, Air Drying Capacity (ADC), as an atmospheric state-variable with significant and direct relevance to the transmission of VRD. <span class='answer'>ADC dictates the evolution and fate of droplets</span> under given temperature and humidity conditions. The definition of this variable is rooted in the Maxwell theory of droplet evolution via coupled heat and mass transfer between droplets and the surrounding environment. We present the climatology of ADC, and compare its observed distribution in space and time to the observed prevalence of influenza and COVID-19 from extensive global data sets. Globally, large ADC values appear to significantly constrain the observed transmission and spread of VRD, consistent with the significant coherency of the observed seasonal cycles of ADC and influenza. Our results introduce a new environmental determinant, rooted in the mechanism of VRD transmission, with potential implications for explaining seasonality of influenza, and for describing how environmental conditions may impact to some degree the evolution of similar VRDs, such as COVID-19.</div>"

Hospitalization is often due to progressive respiratory distress, which, in a proportion of patients, had led to fatalities.2 The geriatric population is at a higher risk, because of their reduced immunity and the presence of comorbid conditions like diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Health authorities have advocated social distancing as a method to contain the spread of this contagious disease. A landmark study has shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can remain viable on various surfaces like cardboard, stainless steel, plastic, and copper for a <span class='answer'>long duration</span>. The research conducted by van Doremalen et al.3 has created an aerosolized environment using SARS-CoV-2 (105.25 50% tissue-culture infectious dose [TCID50] per milliliter) in a Goldberg drum using a 3 jet collision nebulizer and has exposed various materials such as cardboard, paper, stainless steel, plastic, and copper to the virus. The SARS-Cov-2 virus was found to be viable in aerosol for only 3 hours, although its presence on material surfaces lasted significantly longer, especially in stainless steel and plastic surfaces, wherein the virus was detected for up to 72 hours.3.</div>"

However, it is unclear how the viruses survive for such a long time and why their survivability varies across different surfaces. To address these questions, we conduct systematic experiments investigating the evaporation of droplets produced by a nebulizer and human-exhaled gas on surfaces. We found that these droplets do not disappear with evaporation, but instead shrink to a size of a few micrometers (referred to as residues), persist for more than 24 hours, and are highly durable against changes of environmental conditions. The characteristics of these residues change significantly across surface types. Specifically, surfaces with high thermal conductivity like copper do not leave any resolvable residues, while stainless steel, plastic, and glass surfaces form residues from a varying fraction of all deposited droplets at 40% relative humidity. Lowering humidity level suppresses the formation of residues while increasing humidity level enhances it. Our results suggest that these microscale residues can potentially insulate the virus against environmental changes, allowing them to survive inhospitable environments and remain infectious for prolonged durations after deposition. Our findings can also be extended to other viruses transmitted through respiratory droplets (e.g., SARS-CoV, flu viruses, etc.), and can thus lead to practical guidelines for disinfecting surfaces and other prevention measures (e.g., humidity control) for limiting viral transmission.</div>"

Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease <span class='answer'>interventions and intensity</span>. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71–7.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained. Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value. With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.</div>"

Since inflammatory and dysbiotic factors as well as comorbidities affect systemic health, it is possible that periodontal status indicates the risk of complication of COVID-19.

A large number of patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, or valvular heart disease are <span class='answer'>chronically anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonists</span> and rely on frequent follow ups at anticoagulation clinics for management of their anticoagulation therapy. The need for isolation during COVID-19 pandemic can potentially limit access to health care including anticoagulation clinics and directly affect the care of patients on chronic anticoagulation. Therefore, we created a drive-through clinic to bridge the gap of continuation of care and preservation of social distancing precautions. In this manuscript, we report the steps in implementing such initiative which can be applied to other clinics during a pandemic.</div>"

Severity was defined as admission to the hospital or ICU. Methods: This retrospective cohort chart review included patients who received care from March 13 to August 17, 2020, at a single academic medical center. Age, COVID-19 risk factors, sex, race, smoking history, and hospital LOS were analyzed with hospital admission and ICU admission. Categorical variables were summarized. Results: The chart review assessed 1,697 adult patients with various degrees of severity of COVID-19 illness: 23 patients had been admitted to the hospital, and 7 had been admitted to the ICU. Older age and more COVID-19 risk factors, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, were significantly associated with hospital admissions, and longer LOS was statistically associated with ICU admission. Conclusions: Severe COVID-19 infection was associated with older age and more risk factors. Current smoking status, sex, and race were not significantly different between hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 infection who were admitted to the ICU and those who were not admitted to the ICU.</div>"

While the risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been extensively studied, these have been seldom compared with uninfected referents. Methods: We analyzed 341,166 White/Black male veterans tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March 1 to September 10, 2020. The relative risk of 30-day mortality was computed for age, race, ethnicity, BMI, smoking status, and alcohol use disorder in infected and uninfected subjects separately. The difference in relative risk was then evaluated between infected and uninfected subjects. All the analyses were performed considering clinical confounders. Results: In this cohort, 7% were SARS-CoV-2-positive. Age >60 and overweight/obesity were associated with a dose-related increased mortality risk among infected patients relative to those uninfected. In contrast, relative to never smoking, current smoking was associated with a <span class='answer'>decreased mortality among infected and an increased mortality in uninfected</span>, yielding a reduced mortality risk among infected relative to uninfected. Alcohol use disorder was also associated with decreased mortality risk in infected relative to the uninfected. Conclusions: Age, BMI, smoking, and alcohol use disorder affect 30-day mortality in SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects differently from uninfected referents. Advanced age and overweight/obesity were associated with increased mortality risk among infected men, while current smoking and alcohol use disorder were associated with lower mortality risk among infected men, when compared with those uninfected.</div>"

We performed stochastic simulations of early outbreak trajectories that are consistent with the epidemiological findings to date. We found the basic reproduction number, R0, to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4—3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of a similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 1918 pandemic influenza. These findings underline the importance of heightened screening, surveillance and control efforts, particularly at airports and other travel hubs, in order to prevent further international spread of 2019-nCoV.</div>"

To investigate the dynamics of this outbreak, we consider a deterministic compartmental model (SEIR model) with an additional parameter to simulate the restrictions.

Data on the novel CoV respiratory disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]) in patients with cancer are still limited. Unlike other common viruses, CoVs have not been shown to cause a more severe disease in <span class='answer'>immunocompromised subjects</span>.

The viral infection in humans has a range of disease severity from asymptomatic to severe pneumonia and death, whereas the infection in camels is usually asymptomatic. There is no approved antiviral therapy or vaccine for MERS-CoV infections although there have been a number of therapeutic and vaccine candidates under development, for both humans and camels. To date, there has been limited research on the immune responses and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV in both humans and camels.

Thorough investigations of the evolution of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are urgently required. In the current study, we studied amplified fragments of ORF1a/b, Spike (S) gene, ORF3/4a, and ORF4b of four human MERS-CoV strains for tracking the evolution of MERS-CoV over time. METHODS: RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal aspirate, sputum, and tracheal swabs/aspirates from hospitalized patients with suspected MERS-CoV infection were analyzed for amplification of nine variable genomic fragments. Sequence comparisons were done using different <span class='answer'>bioinformatics tools</span> available. RESULTS: Several mutations were identified in ORF1a/b, ORF3/4a and ORF4b, with the highest mutation rates in the S gene. Five codons; 4 in ORF1a and 1 in the S gene, were found to be under selective pressure. Characteristic amino acid changes, potentially hosted and year specific were defined across the S protein and in the receptor-binding domain Phylogenetic analysis using S gene sequence revealed clustering of MERS-CoV strains into three main clades, A, B and C with subdivision of with clade B into B1 to B4. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, MERS-CoV appears to continuously evolve. It is recommended that the molecular and pathobiological characteristics of future MERS-CoV strains should be analyzed on regular basis to prevent potential future outbreaks at early phases.</div>"

In this Communication, we first analyzed two recent studies that concluded that snakes are the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV and that the 2019-nCoV spike protein insertions share a unique similarity to HIV-1. However, the reimplementation of the analyses, built on larger scale data sets using state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods and databases, presents clear evidence that rebuts these conclusions. Next, using metagenomic samples from Manis javanica, we assembled a draft genome of the 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus, which shows 73% coverage and 91% sequence identity to the 2019-nCoV genome. In particular, the alignments of the spike surface glycoprotein receptor binding domain revealed <span class='answer'>four times more variations</span> in the bat coronavirus RaTG13 than in the Manis coronavirus compared with 2019-nCoV, suggesting the pangolin as a missing link in the transmission of 2019-nCoV from bats to human.</div>"

Prevention of future outbreaks is essential and requires understanding pathogenesis and evolution of the virus. We have isolated a SARS-CoV in China and analyzed 47 SARS-CoV genomes with the aims to reveal the evolution trends of the virus and provide insights into understanding pathogenesis and SARS epidemic. Specimen from a SARS patient was inoculated into cell culture. The presence of SARS-CoV was determined by RT-PCR and confirmed by electron microscopy. Virus was isolated followed by the determination of its genome sequences, which were then analyzed by comparing with other 46 SARS-CoV genomes. Genetic mutations with potential implications to pathogenesis and the epidemic were characterized. This viral genome consists of 29,728 nucleotides with overall organization in agreement with that of published isolates. A total of 348 positions were mutated on 47 viral genomes. Among them 22 had mutations in more than three genomes. <span class='answer'>Hot spots of nucleotide variations</span> and unique trends of mutations were identified on the viral genomes.

We observed that variant PEDV strains with novel insertions, deletions, and multiple S gene recombination types were present in China. In addition, mixed infections involving different variant strains were observed in some areas. Based on phylogenetic and recombination analyses, we determined that the newly emerged PEDV variants potentially originated via recombination between the earliest Chinese G1 genogroup strain, JS-2004-2, and earlier Korean pandemic strains.

Notable examples include corticosteroids, interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 1 (IL-1), Janus kinase (JAK), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;) inhibitors. The aim of this narrative review is to analyze the mechanistic rationale and available evidence for these selected anti-rheumatic drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Currently, only corticosteroids have consistently proven to be effective in decreasing mortality and are recommended in clinical guidelines for the treatment of severe and critical COVID-19. Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are ongoing to determine the role of other immunosuppressants.</div>"

We formulated a prevention and control plan for clinical laboratories responsible for detection of the novel coronavirus infection. We analyzed the implementation of this plan and the problems arising from its clinical practice. We found that the layout of most clinical laboratories (including gene amplification laboratories for clinical samples) was inadequate in response to a major outbreak and <span class='answer'>did not meet the requirements for biosafety protection and etiology and serology testing</span>; and laboratory staff showed insufficiencies in their awareness regarding biosafety protection; the functions and status of the laboratory in the fever clinic need to be enhanced to increase its detection capacity; the high density of military personnel, the low level of automation of clinical laboratory equipment, and the lack of biosafety cabinets and personal protective equipment all limit the performance of diverse military operations and major overseas missions. In view of these problems, we propose the following strategies and recommendations: the clinical laboratory needs to standardize the design and staff management according to the standards of P2 laboratory; the detection capacity and staffing of fever clinic laboratory in hospitals need to be strengthened, and a separate clinical gene amplification laboratory can be optimal; for those clinical gene amplification laboratories that fail to meet these standards, reconstruction and upgrade should be made according to the requirements of biosafety protection; for the clinical laboratory in the military medical system, in addition to enforcement of biological safety protection of the staff, sufficient supply of medical materials and biological safety equipment should be ensured and biological safety cabinets should be routinely equipped if possible.</div>"

Methods: The phase Ⅱ trial of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was conducted by Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since October 2020. The subjects were healthy adults aged 18-59 years, not pregnant, and not breastfeeding. The primary vaccination schedule groups were 0-14 d 5 μg, 0-14 d 10 μg, 0-28 d 5 μg and 0-28 d 10 μg, respectively. And 50 participants in each group, a total of 200, who have received 2-doses primary vaccination were selected in ascending order of the study number and vaccinated with a booster dose (<span class='answer'>same dosage as primary vaccination</span>) 6 months post the primary vaccination (30-day window period). Blood samples were collected before and after boosting and tested for the geometric mean titers (GMT) and seroconversion of live virus neutralizing antibody, pseudovirus neutralizing antibody and receptor-binding-domain (RBD) IgG antibody. Adverse event (AE) was collected and assessed within 28 days after boosting. Results: The ages of subjects in group 0-14 d 5 μg, 0-14 d 10 μg, 0-28 d 5 μg and 0-28 d 10 μg were (43.98±9.58), (43.46±9.34), (42.56±9.08) and (43.94±11.05) years old, respectively (P=0.877). Sex ratio were balanced among the 4 groups (P=0.331). The live virus neutralizing antibody GMT (95%CI) in group 0-14 d 5 μg, 0-14 d 10 μg, 0-28 d 5 μg and 0-28 d 10 μg increased from 4.07 (3.30-5.04), 3.75 (3.08-4.55), 8.33 (7.01-11.11) and 7.69 (6.19-9.57) before the booster vaccination to 284.84 (215.28-376.86), 233.05 (178.61-304.08), 274.81 (223.64-337.68) and 280.77 (234.59-336.04) 28 days after the booster vaccination, respectively. Live virus neutralizing antibody seroconversion were all 100% in the 4 groups. The AE incidences following booster vaccination were 18.0% (9 cases), 4.0% (2 cases), 12% (6 cases), and 12% (6 cases) in the 4 groups. No AE was graded as level 3 or worsen. No serious AE was reported. Conclusion: One booster vaccination of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administered 6 months after primary vaccination showed good immunogenicity and safety.</div>"

Using serial interval data from before and after the rollout of nonpharmaceutical interventions in China, we estimate that the relative frequency of presymptomatic transmission increased from 34% before the rollout to 71% afterward. The shift toward earlier transmission indicates a disproportionate reduction in transmission post-symptom onset. We estimate that, following the rollout of nonpharmaceutical interventions, transmission post-symptom onset was reduced by 82% whereas presymptomatic transmission decreased by only 16%. These findings suggest that interventions which limit opportunities for transmission in the later stages of infection, such as <span class='answer'>contact tracing and isolation</span>, may have been particularly effective at reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.</div>"

While nearly all 50 states have implemented some type of stay-at-home policy to encourage social distancing, there has been high variation in the degree of compliance. We argue that this variance is partly driven by gender resentment. Gender resentment reduces trust in female political leaders and thus decreases compliance with government policy and recommendations. Using data from SafeGraph and the 2016 American National Election Study, we demonstrate that the effect of stay-at-home policies on social distancing is reduced when gender resentment increases in states with female leaders. However, when gender resentment is low, there is no difference in the effect of policies on behavior. This research has important implications for understanding <span class='answer'>unseen barriers that can mediate the efficacy of female political leaders</span>.</div>"

Using qualitative interview data, perspectives from both health administrators and service providers working at all levels of China's health care system were examined. Service providers admitted selective adherence and non-adherence to universal precautions in their daily medical practice, and gave their explanations for such behaviors. Lack of time to put on protective gear, gear's interference with medical procedures, lack of administrative support, heavy workload in hospitals, inaccurate risk assessment, and beliefs that compliance with universal precautions is unnecessary, time consuming and costly were mentioned as reasons behind noncompliance.

Air pollution problems cannot be resolved in the short-term; therefore, citizens in regions with low air quality are encouraged to take protective actions such as wearing masks to filter particulate matter. However, compliance with such recommendations is limited. To enhance the effectiveness of health promotion in this regard, this study applied the health belief model to examine the factors that affect mask-wearing behaviors. It also investigates the factors that influence particulate matter-related health beliefs and protective behaviors. A cross-sectional survey with 200 Korean citizens was conducted. The results revealed associations between masking behaviors and both <span class='answer'>perceived benefits of and perceived physical barriers</span> to wearing masks. In addition, sex, education, income, and having heard of different particulate matter-related health consequences were found to predict mask-wearing.

Cybercare means “health care in cyberspace” — for example, doctors consulting with patients via videoconferencing across a distributed network; or patients receiving care locally — in neighborhoods, “minute clinics,” and homes — using information technologies such as telemedicine, smartphones, and wearable sensors to link to tertiary medical specialists. This model contrasts with traditional health care, in which patients travel (often a great distance) to receive care from providers in a central hospital. The Cybercare model shifts health care provision from hospital to home; from specialist to generalist; and from treatment to prevention. Cybercare employs advanced technology to deliver services efficiently across the distributed network — for example, using telemedicine, wearable sensors and cell phones to <span class='answer'>link patients to specialists</span> and upload their medical data in near-real time; using information technology (IT) to rapidly detect, track, and contain the spread of a global pandemic; or using cell phones to manage medical care in a disaster situation. Cybercare uses seven “pillars” of technology to provide medical care: genomics; telemedicine; robotics; simulation, including virtual and augmented reality; artificial intelligence (AI), including intelligent agents; the electronic medical record (EMR); and smartphones. All these technologies are evolving and blending. The technologies are integrated functionally because they underlie the Cybercare network, and/or form part of the care for patients using that distributed network. Moving health care provision to a networked, distributed model will save money, improve outcomes, facilitate access, improve security, increase patient and provider satisfaction, and may mitigate the international global burden of disease. In this paper we discuss how Cybercare is being implemented now, and envision its growth by 2030.</div>"

Extensive and comprehensive literature search was made to collect the data and evidence for experts to review and evaluate the level of evidence. Corresponding recommendations are provided appropriately based on the level of evidence. This updated guideline covers comprehensive topics on CAP, including aetiology, antimicrobial resistance profile, diagnosis, empirical and targeted treatments, <span class='answer'>adjunctive and supportive therapies</span>, as well as prophylaxis. The recommendations may help clinicians manage CAP patients more effectively and efficiently. CAP in pediatric patients and immunocompromised adults is beyond the scope of this guideline. This guideline is only applicable for the immunocompetent CAP patients aged 18 years and older. The recommendations on selection of antimicrobial agents and the dosing regimens are not mandatory. The clinicians are recommended to prescribe and adjust antimicrobial therapies primarily based on their local etiological profile and results of susceptibility testing, with reference to this guideline.</div>"

Even modern <span class='answer'>intensive care</span> has only made a small difference to the mortality in patients with severe pneumonia [3, 4]. While the aging population, increased number of patients with severe co-morbid illnesses, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic have certainly contributed to the persistently high mortality rate [2, 5, 6], apparently healthy, immunocompetent patients continue to die from CAP. Disturbingly, a recent British Thoracic Society study concluded that no available therapy could substantially reduce the mortality rate from severe CAP in young adults [7].</div>"

Rapid developments have taken place over the past decade in our understanding of these arrhythmias and in our ability to diagnose and treat them. The field of catheter ablation has progressed with the development of new methods and tools, and with the publication of large clinical trials. Therefore, global cardiac electrophysiology professional societies undertook to outline recommendations and best practices for these procedures in a document that will update and replace the 2009 EHRA/HRS Expert Consensus on Catheter Ablation of Ventricular Arrhythmias. An expert writing group, after reviewing and discussing the literature, including a systematic review and meta-analysis published in conjunction with this document, and drawing on their own experience, drafted and voted on recommendations and summarized current knowledge and practice in the field. Each recommendation is presented in knowledge byte format and is accompanied by <span class='answer'>supportive text and references</span>. Further sections provide a practical synopsis of the various techniques and of the specific ventricular arrhythmia sites and substrates encountered in the electrophysiology lab. The purpose of this document is to help electrophysiologists around the world to appropriately select patients for catheter ablation, to perform procedures in a safe and efficacious manner, and to provide follow-up and adjunctive care in order to obtain the best possible outcomes for patients with ventricular arrhythmias.

Genomic analysis has revealed that bat and pangolin coronaviruses are phylogenetically related to SARS-CoV-2. The actual origin and passage history of the virus are unknown, but human-human transmission of the virus has been confirmed. <span class='answer'>Several diagnostic techniques</span> have been developed to detect COVID-19 in this prevailing pandemic period. In this review, we provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. The origin, structure, current diagnostic techniques, such as molecular assays based on oligonucleotides, immunoassay-based detection, nanomaterial-based biosensing, and distinctive sample based detection are also discussed. Furthermore, our review highlights the admissible treatment strategies for COVID-19 and future perspectives on the development of biosensing techniques and vaccines for the diagnosis and prevention of the disease, respectively.</div>"
