# OVERVIEW üìö
### ‚úîÔ∏èBACKGROUND
Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused an ongoing outbreak that has become one of the deadliest pandemics in human history. The first known case of the disease was confirmed in Wuhan, Hubei Province of the People's Republic of China, in late 2019, and has since been detected worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHE IC) on 30 January 2020 and assessed IT to have pandemic characteristics on 11 March 2020. UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres has described the COVID-19 pandemic as the most serious crisis humanity has faced since World War II.

### ‚úîÔ∏èPROBLEM
The ongoing pandemic is having a huge impact on all aspects of people's lives around the world. One of the main problems is that the worldwide reaction to COVID-19 has yielded a fast development of articles and scientific publications. This information can help people to understand the virus better. In such difficult times, finding answers on search engines like Google, despite them being the de-facto places to get answers to all queries, can be very frustrating and overwhelming since the information is spread across different web pages. No single web source can provide the answers to all queries. A solution is needed to help people get the answers to all kinds of COVID-19 related queries. Similarly, the outbreak of the COVID-19 has been accompanied by a large amount of misleading and false information about the virus, especially on social media. On February 15th, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not just fighting an epidemic, we‚Äôre fighting an endemic‚Äù. In such a situation, a solution is needed to segregate fake news from authentic news. Another thing worth noting is that the gold standard for coronavirus testing is RT-PCR, which always takes a long time to produce results and costs a lot. A cheaper and faster diagnosis solution is the need of the hour.

### ‚úîÔ∏èSOLUTION
In this project, we have introduced a medical domain-specific chatbot system using natural language processing and deep learning techniques. The system can answer frequently asked queries related to COVID-19 by gathering and summarizing information from various authentic web sources. Moreover, it provides other useful features including the ‚ÄòFake tweet detection‚Äô and ‚ÄòCOVID-19 screening using cough audio recordings‚Äô.
